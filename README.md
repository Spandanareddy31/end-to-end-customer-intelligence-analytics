**End-to-End Customer Intelligence & Analytics Platform**
**📌 Project Description**

An end-to-end Customer Intelligence & Analytics Platform built using Python, SQL, and Power BI to analyze customer engagement, churn risk, and revenue contribution. The platform transforms raw customer and transaction data into actionable insights that support executive decision-making, retention prioritization, and revenue protection strategies.

**🎯 Business Objective**

Organizations often lack clarity on:

1.Which customer segments drive the most revenue

2.Which customers are at risk of churn

3.Where retention efforts should be prioritized for maximum ROI

This project addresses these challenges by combining customer segmentation, engagement analysis, and churn risk assessment into a unified analytics workflow.

**🗂️ Data Overview**

The analysis is based on structured customer and transaction datasets, including:

A) Customer Features

1) Engagement metrics

2) Recency indicators

3) Churn risk flags

4) Customer segment labels

B) Transaction Data

1) Order counts

2) Revenue values

3) Transaction timestamps

C) Derived Analytics Tables

1) Monthly engagement summaries

2) Customer-level risk indicators

3) Segment-level aggregations

**🧠 Analytics Approach**
**1. Customer Segmentation**

Customers are grouped into:

1) High-Value Active – highly engaged, strong revenue contribution

2) Discount-Driven – revenue-generating but churn-sensitive

3) At-Risk / Dormant – low engagement, high churn risk

**2. Engagement Analysis**

1) Monthly active customers tracked using a rolling 30-day window

2) Segment-level engagement trends analyzed over time

3) Order volume compared across customer segments

**3. Churn Risk & Revenue Analysis**

1) At-risk customers identified using recency and inactivity indicators

2) Revenue contribution evaluated at segment and customer levels

3) Risk vs. revenue trade-offs visualized to support prioritization

**📊 Power BI Dashboard Structure**
**🔹 Page 1: Executive Overview**

**Purpose**: High-level snapshot of customer health and revenue performance
Includes:

1) Key KPIs (Customers, Revenue, Orders, AOV, At-Risk Rate)

2) Customer distribution by segment

3) Revenue contribution by segment

4) Segment-level churn risk summary

**🔹 Page 2: Engagement & Activity**

**Purpose**: Understand how customers interact with the platform over time
Includes:

1) Monthly activity consistency matrix

2) Active Customers (30d) trend by segment

3) Total orders by customer segment

**🔹 Page 3: Risk & Revenue Prioritization**

**Purpose**: Enable targeted retention and action
Includes:

1) Revenue vs. churn risk scatter plot by segment

2) Customer-level action table identifying high-value, at-risk customers

**🔑 Key Insights**

1) Revenue is concentrated among High-Value Active customers with low churn risk

2) Discount-Driven customers represent the largest revenue protection opportunity

3) Churn risk is unevenly distributed across segments

4) At-Risk/Dormant customers contribute minimal revenue and offer limited retention ROI

**💼 Business Impact**

This platform enables:

1) Smarter retention budget allocation

2) Early identification of revenue risk

3) Targeted customer-level interventions

4) Clear linkage between engagement behavior and financial outcomes

**🛠️ Tools & Technologies**

**Python (Pandas, NumPy)** – data processing and feature engineering

**SQL** – data querying and aggregation

**Jupyter Notebook** – analytics workflow

**Power BI** – interactive dashboards and executive reporting

**GitHub** – version control and documentation

**🚀 Future Enhancements**

1) Predictive churn modeling

2) Customer lifetime value (CLV) estimation

3) Automated alerts for high-risk customers

4) Integration with CRM or real-time data pipelines
